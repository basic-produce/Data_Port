# Context
The job description seemed pretty straightforward: “Help with INDEX MATCH formulas”. As a Demand Planner, I've used these Excel tricks lots of times to whip up reports or do quick checks.

It was a calm morning when the client showed me what they needed help with. 

After getting access to their file, I quickly realized that using INDEX MATCH formulas wasn't the immediate solution. The reason these formulas weren't working was because the data they had distributed in the catalog form than a data table.

Luckily, the client was totally open to trying new methods, which was great!
